# Calculator
This application was created for an assignment for Prime Digital Academy and uses jQuery, Bootstrap, Node.Js, and Express.

The <b>Calculator</b> functions much like a regular calculator. It takes in 2 values and a type of mathematical operation. The calculator returns the calculated value of the inputs.

## Features

## Usage
Need to run `npm install`. Following that run `npm start` and on your browser go to `localhost:3000`.
